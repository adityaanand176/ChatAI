- **Sign Up / Sign In / Delete Account**
- **Store Messages for each User**
- Uses **Firebase Authentication SDK** and **FirebaseFirestore SDK**
- Error handling with user feedback
- Secure session management

> See `AuthViewModel.swift` and `conversationViewModel.swift` for functions and logic.

## 🎨 UI Design

- Clean and minimal interface
- Dynamic chat bubbles
- State-based rendering for loading/errors
- Auto-scroll and context headline updates

> Visit `ConversationView.swift, LoginView.swift, etc` for UI layout and interaction.

---

## 🧠 Chat Context & Headline

- On receiving a response, the app parses the message context
- The top headline dynamically updates to reflect the core topic
- Helps users stay aware of conversation flow and themes

> Logic handled inside `ChatViewModel.swift` → `provideTitle()` method

---

## 🏗️ Backend Design

- Lightweight client-driven architecture
- Stateless with Firebase session support
- All AI logic handled via OpenRouter proxy to DeepSeek
